# 2020_Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey.
The dataset contained results from a developer survey in which 64461 developers participated in the survey. In this dataset, analysis was carried out on Microsoft Excel.

The Dashboard aimed to answer the following:

- How many developers participated in this survey?
- Find the top 10 countries participating devs are from.
- How many are from Nigeria?
- What's the average age the Nigerian dev wrote their first code?
- What's the average age of the Nigerian dev?
- What are the kinds of employment they are in?
- What's the gender distribution?
- What majors did they study in school?
- What languages have they worked with?
- What's the average number of languages they have worked with?
- What's the average number of years of experience of the Nigerian developer?

- 1. How many devs are women, age below 25 and earn a living from dev?
- 2. What are the 10 most popular languages among Naija devs?

     
64461 developers participated in the survey, out of which 593 participants, representing 0.92%, are Nigerians. Of these 593 Nigerian Developers, only 18.38% of them are working independently.

While the average age of Nigerian developers is 26 years, the average age at which their first code was written is 20 years. Also, 31 Nigerian developers who participated in the survey are Women, out of which 10 of them are below the age of 25.

Furthermore, it is fascinating to note that 468, 417, and 395 Nigerian Developers worked with C, Java, and HTML/CSS Programming Languages, respectively, thus making C Language the most popular language amongst the Nigerian Developers who participated in the survey. Julia seems unpopular in Nigeria, as no participant has ever worked with it.

This Dashboard was created with Microsoft Excel. My favorite tool (Scroll Bar) was added; this will enable users to switch between the Countries to get the necessary information (The Challenge) for the selected country.
