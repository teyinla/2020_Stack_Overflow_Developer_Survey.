# 2020_Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey.
The dataset contained results from a developer survey in which 64461 developers participated in the survey. In this dataset, analysis was carried out on Microsoft Excel.
64461 developers participated in the survey, out of which 593 participants, representing 0.92%, are Nigerians. Of these 593 Nigerian Developers, only 18.38% of them are working independently.

While the average age of Nigerian developers is 26 years, the average age at which their first code was written is 20 years. Also, 31 Nigerian developers who participated in the survey are Women, out of which 10 of them are below the age of 25.

Furthermore, it is fascinating to note that 468, 417, and 395 Nigerian Developers worked with C, Java, and HTML/CSS Programming Languages, respectively, thus making C Language the most popular language amongst the Nigerian Developers who participated in the survey. Julia seems unpopular in Nigeria, as no participant has ever worked with it.

This Dashboard was created with Microsoft Excel. My favorite tool (Scroll Bar) was added; this will enable users to switch between the Countries to get the necessary information (The Challenge) for the selected country.
